                <h2>Submitting Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    If you believe this site would benefit from a new challenge then feel free to submit one! You can submit one by creating a new issue on the website's <a href="https://github.com/hexhowells/neuralgolfing.com/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new+dataset&projects=&template=request-new-dataset.md&title=">GitHub repo.</a>

                <h3>Things to Consider</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To prevent this site being cluttered with inactive challenges, please only submit challenges that are novel and likely require new solutions.</li>
                        <li>The dataset/environment linked to the challenge should be publicly accessible, please provide URLs to source the dataset from</li>
                        <li>Please provide (or suggest) rules for the new challenge, these may be subject to change. General rules can be found <a href="rules.html">here</a>. The following are guidelines for challenge rules:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Have clear and quantifiable completion criteria. Such as certain accuracy, loss, beating X level in Y game, etc.</li>
                            <li>Please don't make the challenge too hard, trying to compress a model whilst beating state-of-the-art results probably isn't too fun.</li>
                            <li>Try to think of ways people can cheat the system (e.g. cropping input images). Generally, the inputs shouldn't be manually modified (No point having a challenge with a dataset if you make your own!)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Providing starter or testing code isn't required but would be beneficial!</li>
                    </ul>
